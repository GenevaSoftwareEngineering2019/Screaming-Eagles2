Monday Oct 22. “America and the Saudis” argues that President Trump has a moral responsibility to speak truth ON the Saudi abuses and directly confront them on their lies concerning the Journalist’s murder. It argues that there is no possible way the murder of this journalist could be considered a rogue act separate from official sanction, and that the Trump administration’s response has not been as clear and confrontational as it should be. The article argues that the U. S. should seek to preserve our important alliance with Saudi Arabia while making clear the murder of journalists is unacceptable and seeking to reduce the Saudi’s bombing of Yemenian Civilians. It argues that we must not pretend nothing has happened, although it also believes that we sometimes have to work with brutal governments in the furtherance of national ends. “No Debate in New York State” looks at the one party system in place in New York. It describes how Cuomo and Gillibrand refused to debate their opponents and praises the New York Post’s attack upon the status quo. It points to how these Democrats disdain Democracy because it is impossible for them to loose, and argues that this is a dangerous blow against government accountability. “Washington’s Carbon Tax: Take Two” looks at the referendum on the Carbon Tax in Washington State as a litmus test for a nationwide program. It describes the proposed increased revenue from such a tax, the manner in which it would affect the price of fuel, and the increased cost for median households. It argues that this cost would particularly affect those with low income and thus some of the increased revenue should be used to reduce energy cost for low income residents. The article points to the industrial exceptions to this tax and argues that such exceptions are hypocritical at best. The article argues that such taxation is only a drop in the bucket compared to what is needed to truly deal with carbon, and that liberals in Washington are more concerned with revenue then the environment. 
Tuesday Oct. 23. “Arms Control for Dummies” praises Donald Trump’s plans to withdraw from the 1987 INF Treaty, which banned mid-range ballistic missiles. It argues that this treaty did not make the world any safer, and that it was in fact the fall of the Soviet Union which did accomplished nuclear peace. It points to the manner in which Russia is not complying with this treaty. It argues that keeping quiet about Russia’s actions will not stop the threat of their actions. It praises Trump’s determination to restore mutual deterrence against Russia and his recognition of other threats. It argues that Trump is demonstrating that he takes treaty violations seriously, and that the current instability is Russia’s fault, who Trump is right in adopting a hard line against. “A Naval Message for China” argues that the movement of two U. S. warships through the Taiwan straight, is part of the Administration’s defence against Chinese aggressiveness. It praises the Trump Government’s determination to protect Taiwan, deter Chinese ambition, and not allow China to expand its influence. “The Caravan to Nowhere” argues that while generous immigration and asylum are important, National Security demands caution when migration becomes a weapon to ferment chaos. It looks at the caravan headed towards the border, arguing that it is organized not for the benefits of the migrants, but against U. S. National interests. It argues that this caravan is an attempt to overwhelm U. S. law, connecting this caravan to the Mariel boatlift from Cuba wherein Castro sent criminals into Florida. It points to left wing Honduran organizers of this caravan, suggests that financial backing is coming from criminal organizations and nongovernmental organizations on the left. It argues that bowing to this migration blackmail would seriously damage legal immigration and asylum seeking, and Trump is right in planning to turn them back.
Wednesday Oct 24th. “Battle of the Statehouses” looks at the Midterm Elections. It argues that when the GOP was galvanized by opposition to Obama and took many statehouses, economic revival occurred. It argues that Democrats are now seeking to ride anti-Trump Sentiment to take back the state governments and chambers in order to take the states in a very different direction. It points to how Republicans cut corporate tax rate and the top marginal tax rate, thereby boosting economic development in their states. It argues that Democrats plan to increase the taxes on businesses and the wealthy to finance their social plans, particularly in education. It praises the Republicans’ saving of taxpayer dollars and their breaking of government monopolies. It argues that Democrats will seek to get rid of both right to work laws and education choices while expanding Medicare. This expansion will squeeze public services and entrap citizens. It argues that America’s national polarization has now filtered down to the states, and a dramatic move in policy will occur depending on the results of the coming elections. “Sandra Day O’Connor’s Witness” describes O’Connor’s announcement of her diagnosis with Alzheimer’s and praises her bravery, her advocacy for civics education and against elections for judges, and her public witness. “Europe’s Growth Problem in Italian” looks at the state of the Italian Economy. It critiques the European Commission’s demand that Italy rewrite it’s budget in accordance with their fiscal policies. It describes the size of Italy’s budget deficit, corruption, and national debt. However, it praises Italy’s two rate flat tax system as a healthy move towards supply side tax reform. It argues the European Commission’s demands for increased taxes will actually lead to a decrease in revenue. It argue that UN Bureaucrats are thwarting the will of Italian voters and making growth impossible. 
Thursday Oct 25th. “Trump Flunks Fed Politics” looks at Trump’s relationship with the Federal Reserve, particularly his desire to keep interest rates low. It praises the Fed Chairman Jay Powell’s concern to not take dictation from the White House, arguing that he faces the challenge of returning monetary policy to normalcy after the dangerous experiment of the Obama administration’s aggressive use of monetary policy. It praises Trump’s tax reform and deregulation while suggesting that Powell must fight to be independent of Trump. It argues that the Fed should have unwound its bond portfolio sooner than it has, and that doing it now while raising interest rates is riskier. It argues that tariffs are too high for growth abroad and that the Fed should ignore the President and focus on tightening the bank. “The Eyes of Oklahoma” praises a ballot measure in Oklahoma that would allow optometrists in big box stores to conduct eye exams and write prescriptions. It argues that the Medical Lobby is opposing this out of their own interests, and that the affordable appointments at a place like Walmart needs to be an option, particularly for those with lower income. “The Politics of Pipe Bombs” looks at the sending of pipe bombs to key democrats, arguing that all those who advocate such violence need to be held accountable. It argues that these attacks cannot be blamed on Trump, just as previous attacks cannot be blamed on Bernie Sanders. This is not the time to settle political scores, and we must lay the blame for all the world’s ills at the feet of those who disagree with us. 
Friday Oct 26th. “Peak Embarrassment in War on Oil” argues against the New York AG’s lawsuit against Exxon. It argues that the AG has continually argued that Exxon has defrauded shareholders without providing a scrap of evidence. The AG claims that Exxon deceived in having two separate cost projections for the cost of Carbon, while Exxon claimed that these two costs were for different areas, and both were shared with investors. The article argues that the future of cost of carbon is greatly uncertain and dependent on political change. It argues that it is the AG and Exxon who has acted fraudently in this situation. “The Avenatti Referral” praises the criminal investigation into Michael Avenatti. This criminal referral argues that Avenatti made false statements in the accusation of Kavanagh, which is in fact a crime. It praises the Senator who made the referral and his concern to deter the politics of personal destruction. “A Connecticut Rescue Plan” critiques Connecticut Governor Democrat Daniel Malloy, arguing his high taxes repress growth, and his high deficits only increase more problems. It argues that increased taxes have driven people out of the state and a promised increase in government spending will not help the situation. Taxpayers aren’t leaving because of bad roads or lack of programs, but because of the crushing tax burden. It praises Republicans’ concern to eliminate estate, corporate, and income taxes in a manner that would greatly benefit the economy and Connecticut’s problems. 
I disagree with “A Naval Message for China”’s implicit argument that the U. S. Government has a responsibility to prevent China from taking too much power to itself. The United States should not think of itself as the policeman of the world, and while we every responsibility to speak out against their injustices, this does not entail intentionally aggravating their military power. I disagree with “America and the Saudi”’s argument that we need to be willing to work with brutal governments if they help further our interests in the Middle East. Pragmatist ethics are gravely dangerous. No matter how much oil they are giving us, we have no right to turn a blind eye to any of the Saudi’s atrocities. We shouldn’t just try to encourage them to decrease their attacks on Yemen, we should exert all the pressure we can to get them to cease. I disagree with “Arms Control for Dummies.” The manner in which other nations treat a treaty should not dictate our response to said treaty. We should hold other nations accountable for their actions, but doing so through building more nuclear weapons ourselves only exasperates the problem. 
I agree with “No Debate in New York State.” In any state wherein only one outlook has achieved full and complete dominance, that party becomes completely lost in their views and concerns and lose touch with reality. Both New York and California demonstrate that when only the Democrats control, they become proudly complacent. I agree with “A Connecticut Rescue Plan”’s argument that decreasing taxes will spur economic development. There comes a point in a tax system at which people are simply not willing to work and look for work elsewhere. Connecticut needs to realize it passed this point a long time ago and stimulate the economy through lower taxes. I agree with “The Eyes of Oklomaha”’s argument that Big Box stores should be allowed to have optometrists, and its implicit argument that the more people are allowed to sell a service, the more competition enables the best possible service. 
The Wall Street Journal is clearly a Conservative Publication. It generally supports President Trump’s actions, (“A Naval Message for China,”) it critiques open borders immigration (“The Caravan to Nowhere”), opposes Transnational regulatory agencies like the UN (“Europe’s growth problem in Italian”) and favors a strong military. (“Arms Control for Dummies”). Most importantly, it argues for supply side economics in which taxes are viewed as dangerous because of a too great decrease in investment in the economy, and flat taxes are favored. “Europe’s Growth Problem in Italian” praises the flat tax system, “A Connecticut Rescue Plan” argues that reducing taxes will increase investment and thus be the only means of restoring Connecticut’s economy, “Battle of the Statehouses” argues that reducing the corporate and top marginal tax rate will benefit the economy and boost job growth, and “The eyes of Oklahoma” argues that the free market is the best means of ensuring all have the best possible service. 
New York Times
Monday Oct 22nd. “A Saudi Prince’s Fairy Tale” looks at the murder of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi. It argues that the crown prince is throwing his hit men under the bus, while Trump does everything in his power to find the Saudis’ story credible. It argues that the Saudi’s official story, wherein the fifteen agents responsible have officially been arrested and the misdeed acknowledged only fools president Trump. It points to the human rights outrages of Prince Mohammed and suggests that Trump must recognize this evil. Nothing honest can be expected from Saudi Arabia, and the US must demand an investigation and seek a restoration of justice. “Brazil’s Sad Choice” is a critique of Jair Bolsonaro, a right wing politician who at the time of writing was a candidate for President of Brazil and is now the President. It attacks his opposition to homosexuality and the global warming movement. The article describes the rampant corruption in Brazil and the manner in which in that situation Bolsonaro’s views are construed as candor and he is believed to be an outsider who will clean up the country. It points to his Christian faith and his combination of social conservatism and economic liberalism, comparing his career to that of Trump. The article argues that Bolsonaro is opposed to the Environment and will dangerously remove protections for the Rainforest. The article argues that when disarray leads to offensive and crude populists, democracy in grave danger.
Teusday Oct 23rd. “Mr. Trump Is Lyin’ Up a Storm” critiques Trump, arguing that he is guilty of demagogy that utterly ignores the truth of reality. It argues that the claims he has been making about immigration lack any grounding in reality. It describes his grumbling insults on twitter that only serve to galvanize his voter base. It argues that his claims about the Honduran caravan are not grounded in reality, but fantastic. It also argues that the leaked memo which will define sex based strictly on biological sex, eliminating the category of transgender individuals in the legal context, will be a blow for the rights of transgender people and civil rights, and will rightly cause fear and anguish among transgender Americans. It argues that Trump is intentionally polarizing America and doesn’t care about anything beyond his own political ends. It points to the growth in the economy, the increase in conservative judges, and deregulation, arguing that the Republican tax cut didn’t prove popular, it failed to replace Obamacare, and Trump’s tariffs are scaring even the Republicans. It argues that Trump’s primary policy concerns, for coverage for preexisting conditions and a tax cut for middle income people, have no basis in reality and that this his only option is revving up his die hard base, which will do nothing for the millions of exhausted Americans. 
Wednesday Oct 24th. “What is Turkey’s Game?” praises Turkey for refusing to allow Saudi Araba to evade responsibility for Khashoggi’s death. It points to their exposure of the killing while the Trump Administration tried to look away. It praises Turkey for directly challenging Turkish power, suggesting that this is not motivated by disinterested principles of justice, but by President Erdogan’s desire to boost their economy through engineering a deal with Saudi Arabia, using the publicity of what they know to increase their own bargaining power. It argues that Turkey is seeking to use the Khashoggi episode to become the dominate power in the region through their influence. It argues that the Turkish Government is seeking to rally its people around a common enemy and will likely succeed. The Turkish government despotically controls its people and intends to use fear to dominate the region. 
Thursday Oct 25th. “Elections Could Be Hacked. Vote Anyway,” looks at the upcoming November elections, arguing that there is a serious possibility the November elections could be hacked. It argues that Russian hackers successfully infiltrated the 2016 Presidential election and that the election systems currently in place are not nearly secure enough to protect people’s votes. It points to the warnings of intelligence officials, arguing that while Trump may not believe the threat is real, the American People do. It argues that Hackers have achieved their goal of sowing pervasive doubt over the integrity of elections and the political process. Russians will continue to disrupt American elections and spread distrust in our highly vulnerable voting system. Those make voting machines insist that their systems are safe, but in fact they are not. These technologies need thorough investigation, but the design companies are unwilling to allow this to happen. It argues that old systems of voting were also highly vulnerable. It points to the ways the system can be repaired in a bipartisan effort, namely, a paper trail for every vote and a risk limiting audit of the vote, along with giving states more resources to secure elections. It argues that voters should vote early and still seek to influence the election, regardless of cyber attacks. 
Friday Oct 26th. “Can Democrats Work with Mr. Trump” argues that Trump has gone all in “with racially charged, ethnonationalist demagogy.” (NYT) It then, however, praises his concern for health care coverage for pre-existing conditions and desire to tackle the high cost of prescription drugs, along with his desire to deal with US infrastructure. It argues that if the Democrats win the House in November, these promises are a starter map on ways in which the Democrats and President Trump can work together on policy. It argues that these areas are in fact shared values and that despite the fact that the Democrats want to drive him from office, there are advantages to at least attempting to work with him. It argues that the Democrats should seek to avoid appearing too partisan and that with the senate remaining Republican, anything truly progressive will not get through, thus turning the Senate against the President and dividing him from his party. It argues that Trump’s fundamental goal is victory, and if he is forced to work with a Democratic House, he will change his plan and cooperate. “’Getting Tough’ Over a Missile Pact” argues that Trump’s withdrawal from the I. N. F. Treaty will only enable Russian Aggression. It reasons that Trump is right in accusing Russia in violating the treaty. Acknowledging the argument for leaving the treaty, namely that Russia abandoned it and China has never been bound to it, it still argues that the US should instead in other weapons with which to defend itself and its allies, rather than ripping up the treaty, which would allow Russia to do as much as it wants. Ripping up the treaty would start a new arms race, and diplomatic means should instead be pursued. It argues that Trump is on a dangerous track in failing to counteract the world’s most dangerous weapons.
I agree with “A Saudi Prince’s Fairy Tale’s” argument that the United States has a direct responsibility to confront the Saudis for their human rights abuses. The Trump Administration has clearly been seeking to do everything in their power to maintain a relationship with the Saudi’s, because of the manner in which they provide a lot of oil wealth to the United States. Instead of this pragmatism, they need to stand firmly for human rights and justice. I agree with “Elections Could Be Hacked. Vote Anyway”’s argument that the election system needs thorough reform. There must be an exhaustive examination of all systems used to ensure they are safe and verification through systems like paper ballots. None of these needs negate the need to actively participate in political society. I agree with “What is Turkey’s Game”’s analysis of Turkish motivations in the Kashoggi issue. Turkey is clearly not acting of the desire for disinterested justice, but out of a desire for domination in the region. 
I disagree with “Mr. Trump Is Lyin’ Up a Storm”’s argument that legally defining gender based on people’s biological sex is a blow to civil rights. Rather, it is recognition that biological entity does not change, no matter how people choose to identify. Transgenderism has been recognized as a mental illness, and no one is any less of a person or an American citizen when they are treated as the actual biological beings that they are. I disagree with “Brazil’s Sad Choice”’s critique of the Brazil President. Bolsonaro is much more aware of economic theory than they suggest, the harsh things they quote is clearly out of context, and evangelical Christianity is not the bogeyman that they believe it to be. I disagree with “Getting Tough Over a Missile Pact”’s argument that the U. S. should continue to hold to the I. N. F. Treaty. Russia is clearly acting in a way that demonstrates that they could care less about that treaty, and we must recognize this and show to the world that such behavior can never be tolerated. 
The New York Times is clearly a liberal publication. It is dogmatically opposed to President Trump, as particularly argued in “Mr. Trump is Lyin’ Up a Storm.” The Tacit assumption of the periodical is that if the administration has made a decision or policy change, it must of necessity be problematic. It distrusts Trump and his word. It’s response to the Saudi Arabia situation constantly demonstrates an inclination to think the worst of the President. “Brazil’s Sad Choice” demonstrates that NYT believes a movement to a Conservative right wing position in politics is not only mistaken, but morally reprehensible. Most fundamentally, the periodical demonstrates a demand side approach to economics. “Can Democrats work With Mr. Trump,” argues that tax cuts motivated by supply economics fail to benefit the economy, and the true need for the economy is further fiscal policies as driven by a Democratic House.
